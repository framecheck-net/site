# My side project about CPU comparison

Hi everyone!

A few weeks ago I was started my project called FrameCheck.  The main goal is to learn how to programing on Node.js and Golang and create useful service. 

So behold! My side project called https://framecheck.net/en/cpu-compare, where you can compare any of 2 CPU side-by-side. We have more than 50 processors right now, but our database grows very quickly.
